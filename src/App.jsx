 React Reducer Hook
     Basically reducers are there to manage state in an application. 
  For instance, if a user writes something in an HTML input field, the 
  application has to manage this UI state (e.g. controlled components).

     In essence, a reducer is a function which takes two arguments:
   the current state and an action -- and returns a new state based on both 
   arguments state.

     Using useReducer over useState makes sense when  multiple stateful 
  values are dependent on each other or related to one domain. For example, 
  stories, isLoading, and error are all related to the "data fetching". 
  In all three (e.g. data, isLoading, error) could be properties in one 
  complex object managed by a reducer instead.
  
  Task: 
    In this section, we will move the stateful stories from React's 
  useState hook to React's useReducer hook. In this section, we will start  
  to manage the "stories and its state transitions "in a reducer.  
   
  Hints on how to accomplish this:
    - First, introduce a reducer function outside of your components. 
    A reducer function always receives a state and an action. Based 
    on these two arguments, a reducer always returns a new state:

      - When a state gets mutated, the component with the state 
      and all child components will re-render.

  Review what is useEffect?
    - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-useeffect-hook/
    
    - What does useEffect do? by using this hook you tell React that 
     your component needs to do something after render.

        returns false, it's removed from the filtered array.

 //useState
    By using useState, we are telling React that we want to have a 
 stateful value which changes over time. And whenever this stateful value 
 changes, the affected components (here: Search component) 
 will re-render to use it (here: to display the recent value).

  //Work flow of a useState:
       When the user types into the input field, the input field's change event 
      runs into the event handler. The handler's logic uses the event's value 
      of the target and the state updater function to set the updated state. 
      Afterward, the component re-renders (read: the component function runs). 
      The updated state becomes the current state (here: searchTerm) and is 
      displayed in the component's JSX.

  //Arrow Function
    function getTitle(title) { - convert to arrow function see below
    
    const getTitle =(title) => 
       (
        title
       );

    Eliminate bracket and "return" statement if no business logic before 
    the function - concise
   

  //Arrow function - 
   If there is a business business logic. Otherwise retain the {} and
   put a "return" statement 
     const App = () => {
       ...
       return xyz;
     } 
 
  //How to use a React.Reducer hook 
  To use Reducer (1) first define a reducer function.
     1. A reducer action is always associated with a type. As best 
        practice with a payload.
        Example:
          const storiesReducer = (state, action) =>{
          if (action.type === 'SET_STORIES'){
            //If the type matches a condition in the reducer. Return a new
            //state based on the incoming state and action
            return action.payload;
          }
          else{
          //throw an error if isn't covered by the reducer to remind yourself
          //that the implementation is not covered
            throw new Error();
          }
        }
      2. The second thing to do is to replaceReact.useState to use a reducer hook
         like this: 

          const [stories, dispatchStories] = React.useReducer(storiesReducer,[]);

          1. receives a reducer function called "storiesReducer"
          2. receives an initial state of empty array []
          3. returns an array with 2 item: 
            - The first item is "stories" which is the current state
            - The second item is the updater function named "dispatchStories"
            Unlike useState, the updater function of Reducer sets the state
            "implicitly" by dispatching an "action". Example:
               dispatchStories({
                 type: 'SET_STORIES',   <== this is the action
               payload: result.data.stories,
             });
